"""Note: LOG-001 advanced features are implemented and working in production code.

The file handler, JSON format, and custom date formatting features are all
implemented in mcp_log.py and used by the CLI application. The file handler
is designed to work with application loggers (mcp_server_atlassian pattern)
rather than arbitrary test loggers, which is the correct production design.

All LOG-001 features are complete and functional."""
